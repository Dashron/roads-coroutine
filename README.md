# roads-coroutine
A simple library to turn javascript generators into promise-returning functions.

The tests are a great place to start. More documentation will come soon.

There are versions of iojs pre-2.5.0 that can generate false "unhandled rejection" events. Please make sure you are using at least 2.5.0
